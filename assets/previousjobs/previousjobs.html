                Managed the development of a CASE tool for design and implementation of various business applications.
                This tool operated under OS/2 and generated MS Windows client/server applications. The code supporting the generated applications 
                is written in C and C++.

                Provided leadership on the design, development and implementation of software design tools on the UNIX operating system.
                Generated a Framework for data and process management by demonstrating competency. in Object Oriented Programming and Graphical User
                Interface Design.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Established a general use library of C++ object classes that encapsulate individual Motif Widgets as well as groups of Motif
                    Widgets. This creation lead to simplified code development as well as less code duplication.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Designed and implemented a graphical interface for the Framework. Implemented this interface using C++, Motif, and the library
                    C++ object classes. The interface provides an editor and additional windows for: creation of graphical representation of processes;
                    the enforcement of process compliance; and the modification of process attributes.

                <li>
                    Composed and executed C++ object classes for evaluation of expressions. This included the development of an expression language using Lex and Yacc.
